About this Dataset
Context

The key to success in any organization is attracting and retaining top talent. I’m an HR analyst at my company, and one of my tasks is to determine which factors keep employees at my company and which prompt others to leave. I need to know what factors I can change to prevent the loss of good people. Watson Analytics is going to help.

I have data about past and current employees in a spreadsheet on my desk top. It has various data points on our employees, but I’m most interested in whether they’re still with my company or whether they’ve gone to work somewhere else. And I want to understand how this relates to workforce attrition.
